Guys!!!

So my phone is Frozen. It got stuck on the pre-boot up screen and wont respond at all, not even the power button. -_-

Thus, I have to wait for the battery to drain out to get it working again. 

Therefore, I wont have access to my phone for quite a while. 


AT WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT TO MEET TODAY? 
Ill probably be at the Bright lab around 2:20. (Hopefully by then my phone is working..)
